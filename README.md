# Parameters 

- Total Bullet Arrays: 
This parameter sets the  amount of total bullet-spawning arrays. 

- Bullets Per Array:
This parameter sets the amount of bullets within each array.

- Spread Between Bullet Arrays: 
This parameter sets the spread between individual bullet arrays. (in degrees) 

- Spread Within Bullet Arrays: 
This parameter sets the spread within the bullet arrays, more specifically, it sets the spread between the first and the last bullet of each array. (in degrees) 

- Starting Angle: 
This parameters sets the starting angle. (in degrees) 

- Spin Rate:
This parameters sets the rate at which the bullet arrays will rotate around their origin. 

- Spin Modificator: 
This parameters sets the modifier with which the Spin Rate will be modified. 

- Invert Spin / Max Spin Rate: 
Invert Spin is technically a boolean, 1 = The spin rate will invert once the spin rate hits the Max Spin Rate.
0 = Nothing happens. 

- Fire Rate 
This parameter sets the rate at which bullets are fired. 1 = High fire rate | 10 = low fire rate

- Object Width 
This parameter sets the width of the bullet firing object.

- Object Height 
This parameter sets the height of the bullet firing object.

- X Offset
This parameter shifts the entire bullet-pattern along the X-Axis

- Y Offset
This parameter shifts the entire bullet-pattern along the Y-Axis

- Bullet Speed
This parameter sets the speed at which the bullets will move along their direction.

- Bullet Acceleration
This parameter sets the rate at which the Bullet Speed will change over time.

- Bullet Curve
This parameter sets the curve at which the bullet will move along.

- Bullet TTL (time to live) 
This parameter sets the amount of ticks each bullet will stay on your screen.
